## Book Applications (book_apps)
Most of the chapters end with an application that demonstrates what the chapter has presented. Students are expected to run these applications and review all of the code to see how they work.

Chapters 3-19 end with applications that build on the Town Hall website. There are no textbook applications for chapters 12, 16, 17, and 19.

## Exercise Starts (exercises)
Exercises at the end of each chapter help students master the skills that are taught in each chapter. For each exercise, students start from folders and files that contain some of the code that the exercise requires. Exercises guide the students through the process of building several pages of a website. These exercises force students to use all of the critical skills that are needed for website development.

## Exercise solutions (solutions)
To help students get over any learning obstacles when they're working on their own, check the solutions to see how something is done.
